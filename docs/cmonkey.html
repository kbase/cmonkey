<p>Module KBaseCmonkey version 1.0 This module provides a set of methods for work with cMonkey biclustering tool.</p>

<p>Data types summary Input data types: ExpressionDataSeries represents a list of expression data samples that serve as an input of cMonkey. ExpressionDataSample data type represents a sample of expression data for a single condition. ExpressionDataPoint data type represents a relative expression value for a single gene. Output data types: CmonkeyRun data type represents data generated by a single run of cMonkey (run_infos table of cMonkey results) CmonkeyNetwork data type represents bicluster network CmonkeyCluter data type represents a single bicluster from cMonkey network, with links to genes, experimental conditions and motifs CmonkeyMotif data type represents a single motif identifed for a bicluster</p>

<p>Methods summary build_cmonkey_network - Starts cMonkey server run for a series of expression data and returns job ID of the run build_cmonkey_network_from_ws - Starts cMonkey server run for a series of expression data stored in workspace and returns job ID of the run build_cmonkey_network_job_from_ws - Starts cMonkey server run for a series of expression data stored in workspace and returns job ID of the run</p>
